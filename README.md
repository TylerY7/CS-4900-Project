# tKinter Mini Project

This is a python script created to utilise the tKinter library in order to create a GUI which allows users to choose an image from their personal machine to be displayed within the GUI.

## Instructions to install python:

If not already installed, you can go to the Python website and install the most recent version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You can verify the installation by running the command:

> `Python3 --version`

Assuming the install ran correctly, you should see something like this

> `Python 3.12.4`

## How to run the script:

Following this, you can copy this GitHub repo to your machine using the `Git clone` command.

After cloning this repo and running the code (assuming everything is correct up until this point), you can run the python script by entering the command:

> `Python3 Individual_Mini_Project.py`

 the script should install the necessary dependencies for you upon running. A seperate application should open which will allow you to run the program.
